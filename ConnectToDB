#Connecting Java to Oracle database 

  We need to have following 5 points - 
    1. Driver class: Oracle database driver class is oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver. 
    2. Connection URL: Connection URL for the 10G database is jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1500:xe
    Here,
      - JDBC is the API
      - Thin is the driver client
      - Localhost is the server name on which oracle is running (may also use IP address)
      - 1521 is the port number 
      - XE is the oracle service name
  
    3. Username: Default username is system. 
    4. Password: Is the password given at the time of installing the oracle database. 
 
Let us consider that we have a table created using the query - create table emp(id number(10),name varchar2(40),age number(3));  


Java class that would allow interfacing would look like - 

      import java.sql.*;  
      class OracleCon{  
      public static void main(String args[]){  
      try{  
          //step1 load the driver class  
          Class.forName("oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver");  
  
          //step2 create  the connection object  
          Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(  
                "jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe","system","oracle");  
  
        //step3 create the statement object  
        Statement stmt=con.createStatement();  
  
        //step4 execute query  
        ResultSet rs=stmt.executeQuery("select * from emp");  
          while(rs.next())  
            System.out.println(rs.getInt(1)+"  "+rs.getString(2)+"  "+rs.getString(3));  
  
            //step5 close the connection object  
            con.close();  
  
        }
        catch(Exception e)
        { 
        System.out.println(e);
        }  
      }  
    }
